Node.js uses a Single Threaded Event Loop architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients. The Node.js processing model is based on a Javascript-event-based model and a callback mechanism. This mechanism based on the event loop allows Node.js to run blocking I/O operations in a non-blocking wayNode.js is easy to learn and quick to adapt, flexible, excellent for calling other services, increases performance and handles a lot of requests, great for real-time applications and helps in building cross-platform applications
